Machine Learning Model Deployment Using Streamlit and FastAPI
1. Build and trained a classification model to predict the obesity risk from oneâ€™s lifestyle, applying preprocessing pipelines and comparing models using different algorithms.
2. Use FastAPI as the backend that will give predictions.
3. Developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard as the frontend that connected to the API, allowing users to input lifestyle data and receive predictions.
